# web3-messages
This solves the issue of communicating with anonymous addresses



## Features
- Supports all blockchains
- Fees/tips to incentivize reading of messages
- Registered accounts can set a minimum fee to receive messages
- Unregistered accounts have an automatically increasing fee. That way, when the user is registered, they won't be overwhelmed with messages. And, that would likely be the case with popular accounts.
- Ability to combine multiple addresses
- Sustainable business model by keeping a portion of the fees/tips



## Ideas
- RSS in web3
- Parallel Crypto Messages
